### Background on DrupalcampNYC provided by Joe at beginning of the meeting, as follows:

* DCNYC first event in 2005. Historically held at Brooklyn Polytech
* When Polytech was acquired by NYU, they jacked the prices unconscionably
* In olden times, drupal agencies like Zivtech would pay for insurance sponsorship
* There was no fiscal sponsorship in those days
* Around 2009/10, I was approached by Jacob Redding, then the ED of the Drupal Association, of serving as the local DA resource to work with the DA as fiscal sponsor of camps in NYC. The expectation from me was to protect the camps from agenting or conflicts of interest, and keeping camps focused on Drupal
* Fiscal sponsorship from the DA included accounts payable, accounts receivable (DA’s bank), legal services, and insurance coverage
* The expectation from us was to publish our GL on Google Sheets. The DA later moved to an Excel format that they would send weekly updates on monies collected or disbursed
* At one time, the NYC group had a DA credit card, which Rich Baldwin managed. That was later removed when the DA ran into some financial issues a few years back. Financial controls remained rigid throughout these years
* DCNYC’s only costs over these years were a) renting premises, b) paying for food coffee, c) minor advertising costs on Facebook, d) paying for the annual domain name drupalcamp.nyc, and e) some SWAG item if there was money left over. Hosting services are provided by Pantheon in exchange for a ‘powered by Pantheon’ logo on the site.
* Typically 70% of the camp’s funds came from corporate sponsors and 30% from attendees. We found that when we began to charge for camps, we had a major uptick in attendance. People that signed up for a free event were less likely to go, it was discovered.
* The financial strategy of DCNYC has always been revenue-neutral. We collect the money that we need for an unconference targeted at 150-200 attendees. The monies are collected for the SUBSEQUENT year’s camp, so funds we raised in 2017 would have been used for a 2018 camp, and any funds we collect this year will go to a 2019 camp, etc.
* The ethos of DCNYC has been unconference, which is where the Drupal NYC community started back in the 2004-2009 era. There was no objection to a mini-con, but it was determined that the unconference was the most federated and transparent way of putting on a camp
* Sponsors were told annually that this isn’t a job fair, they are donating to support the development of the Drupal community in NYC. Therefore, our list of sponsors is an impressive one of companies that care about Drupal. You will be shocked at what companies are NOT sponsors…
* A disclosure item about me, Joe Bachana. Yes, I’m president and founder of DPCI. DPCI has been a general sponsor annually ($500 commitment) and DPCI has received no special mention or presentation on the camp website or anywhere else. Further, I have taken great pains to introduce myself in community meetups or at the camp as just my name, not my company affiliation, so as to avoid gaining any kind of advantage in my volunteerism capacity. Neither I nor DPCI has ever gotten any additional job or sales opportunity from my decade of doing Drupal community service.

### Minutes:
* Drupal Camp NYC collects money in 2018 for use in 2019 (see above for clarification on this point)
* John Jay College (the venue) increased price by 30%
* Drupal Association pulled out support for New York community (actually for all communities): Note, the DA had to do this because a few camps around the country got into financial trouble that hurt the DA causing them to retrench from the fiscal sponsorship offering
* Our options are now to form a 501c(3) for the Drupal New York community or to stay fluid (unincorporated) and use Opencollective.org for fiscal sponsorship.
* Joe does not want to be the sole runner of the camp - Note from Joe: My point is that my term of service has long expired, but I need to emphasize that I am still concerned about the well-being and protection of the community in terms of the promise I made Jacob Redding 9 years ago.
* Our camp revenue is 70% sponsors and 30% attendees contribution
* Shawn spoke about this report on Non-Profit option: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18KiSs5hS6f5hVoW0xOlkaWRlTmbCLGEK52lRic9l5qU/edit#
* Kris: It would be good to have a governance structure, so we have a framework when we have disagreements
* Joe recommends we keep the scope of non-profit to annual camps and leave other things out of scope - Note from Joe: I didn’t recommend that actually. What I said was it is not in our purview to make the determination to broaden it. I said that I think it would be GREAT to have one 501(c)3 to cover all things Drupal in NYC, BUT there is a broader organizer community that needs to ratify this. I also stated that there is a risk that anyone can come out of the woodworks asking for money to put on events. Mani, Ho-Ling and a few others brought up a good point that creating an annual budget along with events proving how THEY can be revenue-neutral (as the camps have been) would safeguard Joe’s concern
* Ho-Ling recommends in the interest of transparency, we have elections every 2 years for office holders. Most agreed, although the concern is that we stagger elections lest we have completely new people on the board every 2 years. In this case, we might want to have the chair be on for 3 years and other positions on for 2. Naturally people can step down if they become overwhelmed.
* Ho-Ling suggests we can earmark budget for various community activities
* Shawn says we might need 5 board members and we need 3 people to be present for quorum in any meeting
* Shawn also talked about a member corporation. A small contribution $5 or $10 gets you in, and then as a member you can vote in elections. Joe noted that this is not enough, it should be $20 so that instantly a ‘member’ now can go to the annual drupalcamp. Its basically prepaying for the camp (and possibly other events) AND it solves the matter of membership allowing for voting rights.
* Approx $100 to $300 to file the non profit. Shawn said he would get us a clearer proposal of exact line-item costs
* Shawn is volunteering to setup and lead the non-profit for the first year. It is do-able if there are 2 other volunteers willing to work with Shawn. Joe notes here that this isn’t just about 2 volunteers, we should begin discussing the structure of the board and the working principles of the group. This would happen AFTER the proposal is looked at/ratified by the broader community of Drupal organizers in NYC
* Ho-Ling: As a 501c3 we would have a logo, which we can use in events etc.
* Ho-Ling: How long would this take? Shawn: Once the initial documents are drafted, setting up the corporation is days; IRS typically takes 2 or 3 weeks for tax-exempt status.
* Ho-Ling: We need a policy / procedure to remove someone from office. Shawn: New York state laws already address this if we have a 501c3. We would also address in proposed bylaws.
* Joe and Jacob spoke about the Open Collective option, here is a report Joe wrote on his research and based on his conversation with Pia Mancini, OC’s Founder: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12vRUkM1zSWrNnqQx4USzayGl4Ny0DicUCI0E74k454k/edit
* Jacob: Open Collective is trying to solve the fundamental problems in open source communities
* Jacob: we can set up multiple small OC for camps, meetups etc.
* Jacob: Any admin (or treasurer) can reimburse for any expense. Another person (approver) has to approve the expense.  Joe: this is incorrect. Please read the report that Joe wrote
* Shawn: we can still use the tooling of OC and have the 501c3
* Joe: OC has legal signatory and bank account
* Joe: OC has a website like eventbrite for registrations etc. and the funds go directly into our OC account
* Joe: OC will provide insurance for the events for a couple of hundred dollars

### Action Items
* Present the 501c3 and OC option to the community in a formal proposal in Google Docs. Shawn is writing this proposal for us to review and edit.
* Shawn will start the initial draft for the 501c3
